The Linux-experiment Project for the Samsung i437

	I am trying to accomplish a successfull and controllable linux VT boot instead of the
	Android screens and apps that we are all used to.

	If this project is successfull then later it may be used with freedreno for a 
	graphical boot in X11 or Wayland.

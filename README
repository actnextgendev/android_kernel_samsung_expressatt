VERY EXPERIMENTAL - not responsible for possible nuclear war by using this code

	Due to the unknown issues experimented in compiling I am attempting to update any offending code to
	try and fix many recurring problems. If this is successful it will be merged to the main linux-experiment
	branch.
	
	The code that I am referencing is @Cyanogenmod/android_kernel_samsung_d2 soon I hope to also use msm 3.0
	kernel code to get the best possible drivers.
	
	If there is anyone who finds that I need to license something or give any credit where it isn't already
	just comment so on the issue for credit/licensing.
